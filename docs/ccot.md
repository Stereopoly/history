#Continuity and Change

### Industrial Revolution
Before the Industrial Revolution, America focused more on the acquisition of land rather than the protection and preservation United States soil,  as shown through the Louisiana and Gadsden Purchases. However, the Industrial Revolution introduced new environmental issues, including pollution and the contamination of many habitats and bodies of water. From the mid-1800s and onwards, American government introduced environmental protection acts and national parks like Yellowstone and the Clean Water Act of 1963 to protect our resources and save the environments polluted by industry and innovation. As America saw its country beginning to deteriorate environmentally, it introduced acts to preserve and protect our nation's land.
