### Regarding Slavery

The period of slavery in the 1800s by America is similar to the imperialism period that overtook Europe during 1870 to 1970. In both circumstances, slavery was instituted into colonies or states under white rule. In Europe, the implementation of the British Raj and the British East India Company as well as the Scramble for Africa and the Berlin Conference allowed for Britain to establish slavery and free labor over these colonies. A similar approach happened in America, in which the Confederacy implemented slavery and segregation over Southern states, limiting the rights of the “other,” meaning people not of European descent. To add, the ideas of Social Darwinism and the “White Man’s Burden” to educate races inferior to whites by colonizing societies was implemented in America as they constructed their slavery system. Social Darwinism was a large part in mistreatment of black Americans, as whites felt they were the superior race and therefore had more rights than colored people. Both countries introduced slavery and racism into their societies.
