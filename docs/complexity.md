### Regarding Slavery

The period of slavery in the 1800s by America is similar to the imperialism period that overtook Europe during 1870 to 1970. In both circumstances, slavery was instituted into colonies or states under white rule. In Europe, the implementation of the British Raj and the British East India Company as well as the Scramble for Africa and the Berlin Conference allowed for Britain to establish slavery and free labor over these colonies. A similar approach happened in America, in which the Confederacy implemented slavery and segregation over Southern states, limiting the rights of the “other,” meaning people not of European descent. To add, the ideas of Social Darwinism and “White Man’s Burden” to educate races inferior to whites by colonizing societies was implemented in America as they constructed their slavery system. Social Darwinism was a large part in mistreatment of black Americans, as whites felt they were the superior race and therefore had more rights than colored people. Both countries introduced slavery and racism into their societies. 

### Regarding Industrial Revolution

The Industrial Revolution that occured in the United States had attributes like the one that occurred starting in Britain and spreading through Western Europe. In Britain, the first signs of the revolution was the mechanizing of the textile industry with inventions like the Water Frame. This allowed for much faster production of textiles and gave Britain an edge over other countries’ competition. It soon spread even as Britain tried to keep secret how its machines were made. The mechanization of industry also occured in the United States in a similar fashion as capitalists wanted to make more money without increasing their costs of labor. This lead to first the creation of smaller factory systems like the Lowell Mills, but later on, large conglomerates that had full horizontal integration for a certain commodity. This was a much more dominant theme in the United States compared to Europe where it did not proliferate with capitalistic urge.
