            "text": "Environment and Geography\n\n\nPeriod 1\n\n\nPeriod 2\n\n\nPeriod 3: 1754-1800\n\n\nPeriod 4: 1800-1848\n\n\nManifest Destiny\n\n\nManifest Destiny was the belief that American expansion was inevitable and good for North America.  Western expansion into Native American territory and the acquirement of new lands were due to the ideals of Manifest Destiny and the feeling that the settlers of America, both those that had been there and those coming sought to seek a better life with more land and that they deserved this American dream.\n\n\n\n\nWestern Civilization developed under the ideas of Manifest Destiny due to the settlers seeking more land, and the land in the west (Native American land) belonged to the settlers rather than those who were already there.\n\n\nLouisiana Purchase:  Under Thomas Jefferson this ideal of Manifest Destiny was spreading, and he purchased the Louisiana territory from the French to explore and give land to deserving Americans.  The act was really outside of his executive power, however, it was allowed to complete because it was deemed by the new \u201cJudicial Review\u201d that it was constitutional because of the benefits it provided for the country and the people.\n\n\nLewis and Clark: set out to explore this territory\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew York: Immigrants came pouring into the country to seek land for farming and agriculture and to escape the things happening in their respective countries.  New York was the largest \u201cportal\u201d into America as many immigrants came to the New York Harbor to start their new lives in the states.\n\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\nTechnology: Technological advancements made it much easier for those living in the US to expand further, especially west.  They made transportation easier, communication better, and the idea of exploring and acquiring new lands from a dream into a reality.\n\n\n\n\nSteamboats: Steamboats made easy access of the waters that have proved too treacherous/expensive to cross before the development of these boats, allowed products to be moved much more easily.\n\n\nErie Canal: The creation of the Erie Canal was beneficial to the country as it allowed the Steamboats new paths and easier access to so many parts of the country.\n\n\nRailroads/Telegraph: The Telegraph improved communication greatly, as information could be passed much more easily over long distances, with less of a chance of intercepted information.  The Railroad allowed people to travel much more quickly (than horse and carriage, for example) and access these new lands in the west.\n\n\n\n\nSlavery\n\n\nSlavery: Slavery plagued the country, but was also something that attracted many white farmers.  The cheap labor that slavery provided and the legality of slavery in many states drew many people toward the southern states which were also good for agriculture due their soil and expansion of land.\n\n\n\n\nMissouri Compromise: The Missouri Compromise developed the 36\u201930 line that said any states added to the Union that were geographically above that line were to be free states, and those states admitted to the Union that were below that line would be slave states.  It changed the flow of slavery and the influx of farmers toward those southern states where slavery was allowed.\n\n\nKansas-Nebraska Act: This Act repealed the Missouri Compromise.  It said that states could choose themselves whether they wanted to allow slavery or make it illegal, rather than the line that had decided that before this act.  This act was brutal and lead to Bleeding Kansas, but it also meant that many farmers began travelling around and living in these new states to help the votes go towards the side of making slavery legal so that politically, slave states would carry more power than free states (more of them).\n\n\nCotton: This became the biggest cash product of slavery.  While the textile industry succeeded in the north, the south became the biggest farmers of cotton in the world, all due to the fact they that they had slaves to do the work for them.  \n\n\nEli Whitney \u2192 Cotton Gin: Cotton was an important cash product, taking over from things like tobacco, but it was made even more effective by the creation of the Cotton Gin by Eli Whitney that made cotton production and farming much quicker so that more could be produced daily.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeriod 5: 1844-1877\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\nMore technological developments altered the landscape of the battle for power between the agricultural industry and the manufacturing industry.\n\n\n\n\nFactories: The development of factories made manufacturing easier and quicker, although more dangerous in many ways.  It lead to the development of labor unions and other battles between workers and their employers.  However, factories provided many jobs to those searching for work, and these factories meant that many immigrants started working in them as they either did not have skills to do otherwise or were not allowed work.\n\n\nTranscontinental Railroad: This essentially connected the entire country.  It was the longest railroad and ran all the way across the country, allowing for easy migration from one state to another depending on the benefits of living in different states for different people.\n\n\n\n\nSlavery\n\n\nSlavery was still evident until the end of the Civil War and was the reason for the Civil War. Debates about slavery and slave states vs free states still determined the agricultural industry and the different levels of success it had.\n\n\n\n\nCompromise 1850: This was another new slave state act that allowed California to enter as a free state. It was important because slave trade was abolished as a result of this act, and other territories were affected greatly as well (Texas, New Mexico).\n\n\n\n\nUrban vs Agrarian\n\n\nAfter the Civil war, the Reconstruction period was one of differing degrees of success for different groups of people.  However, the landscape became one of much separation between an agrarian lifestyle and the new urban movement that started taking over many people.\n\n\nReconstruction Act\n\n\nThe Reconstruction Act readmitted the seceded southern states back into the Union and set out to allow new rights to the freed ex-slaves.  There were new rules and a hope to limit the political power of the South, but it was not as successful as hoped.\n\n\n\n\nSouthern Growth: Southern states started growing very quickly, gaining more power and stopping the Reconstruction Act limits that had been placed on these states.  They also created many laws to limit the rights of Black people in the country, and found loopholes that made sure the limits placed were legal.\n\n\n\n\nTrans-Mississippi West\n\n\nMore land was made available for agriculture in this time than in the past 250 years.  This crazy amount of land was made available due to the Indians being pushed further out, and this lead to conflict with the Native Americans.  Farming became more difficult, however, and women worked to get larger roles than they had been allowed before the war.  Too many crops were being produced which meant that prices of products fell and smaller farms suffered greatly, which allowed bigger agricultural companies to take control.\n\n\nPeriod 6: 1865-1898\n\n\nPeriod 7: 1890-1945\n\n\nPeriod 8: 1945-1980\n\n\nManhattan Project\n\n\nThe United States developed the atomic bomb and was lead by J. Robert Oppenheimer\n\n\nHiroshima and Nagasaki\n\n\nAllies dropped the first atomic bomb in these two Japanese cities. This had lasting radioactive effects on the area including birth defects and cancer.\n\n\nH-Bomb\n\n\nThe United States developed this bomb which was 1000x stronger than the atomic bombs in the past in 1952.\n\n\nBrinkmanship\n\n\nThis policy was followed lead by John Foster Dulles and Allen Dulles which advocated aggressive foreign policy to achieve the outcomes the United States wanted.\n\n\nMutually Assured Destruction\n\n\nIf either the United States or the Soviets would attack, the world would be completely destroyed, so no one dared do anything.\n\n\nDuck and Cover\n\n\nThese drills were performed in schools with the chance of there being nuclear attacks during this time of high tensions.\n\n\nClean Air Act of 1963\n\n\nThis was passed in response to public concern after Silent Spring, and it funded research to limit air pollution.\n\n\nPeriod 9: 1980-Present\n\n\nSilent Spring\n\n\nA movement lead by Rachel Carson which documented the effects of pesticides on the environment.\n\n\nThe Population Bomb\n\n\nA book written by Stanford professor Paul Ehrlich to warn the public of overpopulation following the Baby Boom.\n\n\nEnvironmental Protection Agency\n\n\nThis was founded by President Richard Nixon in 1970 to protect the health of Americans and the environment, and created offices for pollution prevention.\n\n\nClean Water Act of 1972\n\n\nThis was passed to protect wetlands and the nation\u2019s water supply which gave funding for research and protection.\n\n\nOPEC\n\n\nThey performed an oil embargo on countries allied with Israel in the Yom Kippur war in 1973. This lead to rising gasoline prices and hardships for the American automobile industry.",
