            "text": "Environment and Geography\n\n\nPeriod 1\n\n\nChristopher Columbus\n\n\nAlthough not the first to arrive in America (see Native Americans), his eventual somewhat successful journey of discovery the New World for the Europeans allowed Spanish and Portuguese to start pouring in and claiming land for their own, followed by the British.\n\n\nFrench Arrival\n\n\nFrance decided to wait longer before exploring the New World, despite their very large population, and this hurt their opportunity for power in the new world because of the developments already made by the other countries when they arrived.  Their main priority was resources more than anything else, but they saw America as more of a border to cross rather than land to be cultivated, so they left it alone more than the other countries.\n\n\nPeriod 2\n\n\nGreat Migration\n\n\nThere were two \u201cGreat Migration\u201ds, and they are very different from each other.  The Great Migration in the 1620s was of Puritans coming to America for a spiritual and righteous purpose rather than for the possibility of a greater economic future.  The Puritans who came over were middle class and not poor, and were very skilled; economic struggle was not their reason for moving to Massachusetts, but religious freedom was. \nIt was these Puritans who created Thanksgiving, in 1633 and 1634.\n\n\nWalking Purchase\n\n\nThis was an agreement between Penn (Pennsylvania) and the Delaware Indians for the Indians to vacate much of the land available in the soon to be Pennsylvania colony, so that Americans could move into and use it.  It had a supposed area of around 1,200,000 acres available for settlers to use.\n\n\nSecond Wave\n\n\nThe Puritans were very picky with who they allowed into Massachusetts, and it meant many new settlers had to seek out other lands for use rather than living with the Puritans.  The second wave consisted of many less religious people who came for economic reasons, unlike the Puritans.  Their main places for settling were Rhode Island and New England.\n\n\nPeriod 3: 1754-1800\n\n\nGuerilla Warfare During American Revolution\n\n\nAmerican soldiers gained advantage during the American Revolution because they knew the land and had home field advantage, and could therefore set up surprise attacks and ambushes on British soldiers. \n\n\nOhio Company\n\n\nThe Ohio Company French owned everything on one side of the Ohio River, stole land from Indians, used it to grow crops and make an economic profit, caused French and Indian War\n\n\nWestward Expansion Across Mississippi\n\n\nThis proclamation line forbid expansion. Native land was destroyed in conflicts with colonies, Jefferson in favor of NA - wanted agrarian society, NA move west of Mississippi River - Andrew Jackson, Left out of Treaty of Paris\n\n\nLand Ordinance of 1785\n\n\nThis set up a standardized system whereby settlers could purchase title to farmland in the undeveloped west, old all land in the Northwest, 100,000 Indians lived in land extended to mississippi river, Settlers paid little land to natives\n\n\nTreaty of Greenville (1795)\n\n\nGreenville Treaty Line, which was for several years a boundary between Native American territory and lands open to European-American settlers. The latter frequently disregarded the treaty line as they continued to encroach on Native American lands\n\n\nPeriod 4: 1800-1848\n\n\nManifest Destiny\n\n\nThis was the belief that American expansion was inevitable and good for North America.  Western expansion into Native American territory and the acquirement of new lands were due to the ideals of Manifest Destiny and the feeling that the settlers of America, both those that had been there and those coming sought to seek a better life with more land and that they deserved this American dream.\n\n\n\n\nWestern Civilization developed under the ideas of Manifest Destiny due to the settlers seeking more land, and the land in the west (Native American land) belonged to the settlers rather than those who were already there.\n\n\nLouisiana Purchase:  Under Thomas Jefferson this ideal of Manifest Destiny was spreading, and he purchased the Louisiana territory from the French to explore and give land to deserving Americans.  The act was really outside of his executive power, however, it was allowed to complete because it was deemed by the new \u201cJudicial Review\u201d that it was constitutional because of the benefits it provided for the country and the people.\n\n\nLewis and Clark: set out to explore this territory\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew York: Immigrants came pouring into the country to seek land for farming and agriculture and to escape the things happening in their respective countries.  New York was the largest \u201cportal\u201d into America as many immigrants came to the New York Harbor to start their new lives in the states.\n\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\nTechnological advancements made it much easier for those living in the US to expand further, especially west.  They made transportation easier, communication better, and the idea of exploring and acquiring new lands from a dream into a reality.\n\n\n\n\nSteamboats: Steamboats made easy access of the waters that have proved too treacherous/expensive to cross before the development of these boats, allowed products to be moved much more easily.\n\n\nErie Canal: The creation of the Erie Canal was beneficial to the country as it allowed the Steamboats new paths and easier access to so many parts of the country.\n\n\nRailroads/Telegraph: The Telegraph improved communication greatly, as information could be passed much more easily over long distances, with less of a chance of intercepted information.  The Railroad allowed people to travel much more quickly (than horse and carriage, for example) and access these new lands in the west.\n\n\n\n\nSlavery\n\n\nSlavery plagued the country, but was also something that attracted many white farmers.  The cheap labor that slavery provided and the legality of slavery in many states drew many people toward the southern states which were also good for agriculture due their soil and expansion of land.\n\n\n\n\nMissouri Compromise: The Missouri Compromise developed the 36\u201930 line that said any states added to the Union that were geographically above that line were to be free states, and those states admitted to the Union that were below that line would be slave states.  It changed the flow of slavery and the influx of farmers toward those southern states where slavery was allowed.\n\n\nKansas-Nebraska Act: This Act repealed the Missouri Compromise.  It said that states could choose themselves whether they wanted to allow slavery or make it illegal, rather than the line that had decided that before this act.  This act was brutal and lead to Bleeding Kansas, but it also meant that many farmers began travelling around and living in these new states to help the votes go towards the side of making slavery legal so that politically, slave states would carry more power than free states (more of them).\n\n\nCotton: This became the biggest cash product of slavery.  While the textile industry succeeded in the north, the south became the biggest farmers of cotton in the world, all due to the fact they that they had slaves to do the work for them.  \n\n\nEli Whitney \u2192 Cotton Gin: Cotton was an important cash product, taking over from things like tobacco, but it was made even more effective by the creation of the Cotton Gin by Eli Whitney that made cotton production and farming much quicker so that more could be produced daily.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeriod 5: 1844-1877\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\nMore technological developments altered the landscape of the battle for power between the agricultural industry and the manufacturing industry.\n\n\n\n\nFactories: The development of factories made manufacturing easier and quicker, although more dangerous in many ways.  It lead to the development of labor unions and other battles between workers and their employers.  However, factories provided many jobs to those searching for work, and these factories meant that many immigrants started working in them as they either did not have skills to do otherwise or were not allowed work.\n\n\nTranscontinental Railroad: This essentially connected the entire country.  It was the longest railroad and ran all the way across the country, allowing for easy migration from one state to another depending on the benefits of living in different states for different people.\n\n\n\n\nSlavery\n\n\nSlavery was still evident until the end of the Civil War and was the reason for the Civil War. Debates about slavery and slave states vs free states still determined the agricultural industry and the different levels of success it had.\n\n\n\n\nCompromise 1850: This was another new slave state act that allowed California to enter as a free state. It was important because slave trade was abolished as a result of this act, and other territories were affected greatly as well (Texas, New Mexico).\n\n\n\n\nUrban vs Agrarian\n\n\nAfter the Civil war, the Reconstruction period was one of differing degrees of success for different groups of people.  However, the landscape became one of much separation between an agrarian lifestyle and the new urban movement that started taking over many people.\n\n\nReconstruction Act\n\n\nThe Reconstruction Act readmitted the seceded southern states back into the Union and set out to allow new rights to the freed ex-slaves.  There were new rules and a hope to limit the political power of the South, but it was not as successful as hoped.\n\n\n\n\nSouthern Growth: Southern states started growing very quickly, gaining more power and stopping the Reconstruction Act limits that had been placed on these states.  They also created many laws to limit the rights of Black people in the country, and found loopholes that made sure the limits placed were legal.\n\n\n\n\nTrans-Mississippi West\n\n\nMore land was made available for agriculture in this time than in the past 250 years.  This crazy amount of land was made available due to the Indians being pushed further out, and this lead to conflict with the Native Americans.  Farming became more difficult, however, and women worked to get larger roles than they had been allowed before the war.  Too many crops were being produced which meant that prices of products fell and smaller farms suffered greatly, which allowed bigger agricultural companies to take control.\n\n\nPeriod 6: 1865-1898\n\n\nSeparation of States During Civil War\n\n\nBefore the Civil War, America was divided into essentially a slave south and a free north. The Southern states included South Carolina, Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Virginia, and Texas. These were the Confederacy, and declared their secession because they disliked abolitionist movement and Lincoln\u2019s goals for his presidency. The border states were Arkansas, Tennessee, and North Carolina. They were neutral but still had slavery. Finally, the Northern states were Maine, New York, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Kansas, Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa, California, Nevada, and Oregon. These states were the Union, and were free states under Abraham Lincoln.\n\n\nSharecropping (1865)\n\n\nThe South had established a cotton based economy and relied heavily on slave labor to meet their quota. After slavery was abolished, sharecropping was establishing. Sharecropping is essentially when a black family rented a plantation and supplies to work. They would pay for crop rent and seeds tools, leaving very little left for their profit. Often, blacks were left  in debt and had a dependence on cotton production because they couldn\u2019t secure jobs elsewhere. This continued the separation between wealthy planter elite and poor.\n\n\nIndian Reservation Systems (Dawes act, Wounded Knee Massacre) (1870s)\n\n\nThere was continued marginalization of the Native Americans. The Dawes Act authorized the President of the United States to survey American Indian tribal land and divide it into allotments for individual Indians. The wounded New Massacre was resulted in over 150 Lakota Indians being killed because the government wanted to disarm the tribe.\n\n\nYellowstone National Park (1872)\n\n\nYellowstone National Park was established by the U.S. Congress and signed into law by President Ulysses S. Grant. It was the first national park in the U.S. and is also widely held to be the first national park in the world.\n\n\nHatch Act (1887)\n\n\nThis act provided federal support for agricultural research and experiment stations.\n\n\nEnvironmental Effects\n\n\nPollution increased due to industrialization. The drought on the plains called for federal irrigation.\n\n\nPeriod 7: 1890-1945\n\n\nPhilippine War (1899 - 1902)\n\n\nThe Philippine War timeline includes the Annexation of Hawaii, Acquisition of Philippines, Puerto Rico, Guam, and qualified sovereignty for Cuba. It ended in the Platt Amendment, which was an amendment to the new Cuban constitution that authorized U.S. intervention in Cuba to protect its interests. Cuba pledged not to make treaties with other countries that might compromise its independence, and it granted naval bases to the United States, most notable being Guantanamo Bay. The war ended with the U.S. gaining naval and commercial power through foreign outposts. There was an initial welcome in former Spanish colonies for U.S. forces because they were an agent for expansion of trade and social order and social reform and national self-rule.\n\n\nLacey Act (1900)\n\n\nThis act prohibits trade in wildlife, fish, and plants that have been illegally taken, possessed, transported, or sold.\n\n\nFirst National Refuge Created (1903)\n\n\nRefuges protects animals.\n\n\nU.S. Forest Service Created (1905)\n\n\nThe US Forest Service administers the nation's 154 national forests and 20 national grasslands, which encompass 193 million acres.\n\n\nAntiquities Act (1906)\n\n\nThis act gives president authority to create and protect national monuments.\n\n\nNational Park Service (1916)\n\n\nThe National Park Service manages all national parks, many national monuments, and other conservation and historical properties with various title designations.\n\n\nRussian Revolution (1919)\n\n\nThe Russian Revolution was when the US allied with other countries to combat spread of communism (utilization of land). In Europe, there was a spread of communist-led government's, which resulted in general strikes, peasant movements, anti-colonial campaigns, and counter-mobilization. The Allies intervened with the Soviet Union\u2019s practices, but there were limits of Wilson's internationalism, and contributed to the receding of postwar radicalism around world. Similarly to WWI, it was the Allied Powers (Britain, France, Russia, Japan) versus Central Powers (Germany, Austria-Hungary, Ottoman Empire).\n\n\nDust Bowl (1930 - 1936)\n\n\nThe Dust Bowl was a period of severe dust storms that greatly damaged the ecology and agriculture and caused severe drought. Famers deep plowed virgin topsoil, which caused lots of dust to blow, hence the \u201cDust Bowl.\u201d This created a  period without growth of crops and led to the Great Depression.\n\n\nAgricultural Adjustment Act (1933)\n\n\nUnder the New Deal, FDR established the AAA. Its goal was the revival of farm prices and incomes; however, it contributed to an  uneven impact on farmers, where there were gains for landowning farmers, but exclusion and displacement of tenants, sharecroppers. It ultimately worsened rural hardship, and along with the Dust Bowl contributed to the mass displacement of Farmers.  The hardships are documented in John Steinbeck's The Grapes of Wrath.\n\n\nJapanese Concentration Camps (1942 - 1946)\n\n\nThe government used these to isolate Japanese from society. After Pearl Harbor, Japanese people were dehumanized and sent to concentration camps.  FDR's Executive Order 9066 ordered the Japanese to expulsion in internment camps and negated their civil liberties. The Supreme Court affirmed FDR\u2019s order through Korematsu v. United States, as they stated the exclusion order was constitutional.\n\n\nJohn Muir\n\n\nKnown as the \"Father of the National Parks,\" John Muir was an environmental philosopher, advocate for the preservation of wilderness in the United States, and an advocate for the preservation the Yosemite Valley, Sequoia National Park and many other wilderness areas. He co- founded The Sierra Club, a prominent American conservation organization that helped preserve national parks.\n\n\nPeriod 8: 1945-1980\n\n\nManhattan Project\n\n\nThe United States developed the atomic bomb and was lead by J. Robert Oppenheimer\n\n\nHiroshima and Nagasaki\n\n\nAllies dropped the first atomic bomb in these two Japanese cities. This had lasting radioactive effects on the area including birth defects and cancer.\n\n\nH-Bomb\n\n\nThe United States developed this bomb which was 1000x stronger than the atomic bombs in the past in 1952.\n\n\nBrinkmanship\n\n\nThis policy was followed lead by John Foster Dulles and Allen Dulles which advocated aggressive foreign policy to achieve the outcomes the United States wanted.\n\n\nMutually Assured Destruction\n\n\nIf either the United States or the Soviets would attack, the world would be completely destroyed, so no one dared do anything.\n\n\nDuck and Cover\n\n\nThese drills were performed in schools with the chance of there being nuclear attacks during this time of high tensions.\n\n\nClean Air Act of 1963\n\n\nThis was passed in response to public concern after Silent Spring, and it funded research to limit air pollution.\n\n\nPeriod 9: 1980-Present\n\n\nSilent Spring\n\n\nA movement lead by Rachel Carson which documented the effects of pesticides on the environment.\n\n\nThe Population Bomb\n\n\nA book written by Stanford professor Paul Ehrlich to warn the public of overpopulation following the Baby Boom.\n\n\nEnvironmental Protection Agency\n\n\nThis was founded by President Richard Nixon in 1970 to protect the health of Americans and the environment, and created offices for pollution prevention.\n\n\nClean Water Act of 1972\n\n\nThis was passed to protect wetlands and the nation\u2019s water supply which gave funding for research and protection.\n\n\nOPEC\n\n\nThey performed an oil embargo on countries allied with Israel in the Yom Kippur war in 1973. This lead to rising gasoline prices and hardships for the American automobile industry.",

It said that states could choose themselves whether they wanted to allow slavery or make it illegal, rather than the line that had decided that before this act.  This act was brutal and lead to Bleeding Kansas, but it also meant that many farmers began travelling around and living in these new states to help the votes go towards the side of making slavery legal so that politically, slave states would carry more power than free states (more of them).  Cotton: This became the biggest cash product of slavery.  While the textile industry succeeded in the north, the south became the biggest farmers of cotton in the world, all due to the fact they that they had slaves to do the work for them.    Eli Whitney \u2192 Cotton Gin: Cotton was an important cash product, taking over from things like tobacco, but it was made even more effective by the creation of the Cotton Gin by Eli Whitney that made cotton production and farming much quicker so that more could be produced daily.",
